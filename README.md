# kleis

A hardened, minimalist screen locker for Wayland compositors that
implement `ext-session-lock-v1`.

kleis began as `lockme`, a Wayland locker; it is the same code under a new name.

**Status (branch `sophia-port`):** kleis is becoming a native Sophia lock
provider. On Sophia it only renders: Session owns the lock and the password,
and kleis never sees a character. The Wayland, PAM and password code is gone
from this branch, which connects to Sophia's lock files through the vendored
C desktop SDK. It ships once that SDK's lock client is released, and the
Wayland instructions below describe `lockme`, not this branch. See
[docs/sophia-port-plan.md](docs/sophia-port-plan.md).

`kleis` aims at one thing: keep a typed password out of every place
the kernel and userspace would otherwise let it leak.

The password buffer is page-aligned, `mlock`'d, marked
`MADV_DONTDUMP`, and wiped with `explicit_bzero` on every clear. The
locker process drops dumpability, denies new privileges, and
suppresses core dumps. PAM runs in a forked child that talks back
over a length-prefixed pipe, so a misbehaving auth module never
shares an address space with your secret.

The UI defaults to GPU-rendered Matrix rain while idle. Typing switches to a
solid configurable palette, failed auth shows a solid failure color, and `Alt-B`
toggles between Matrix and a blank screen. Colors and the rest of the runtime
knobs live in a small KDL 2.0 config file (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

It is small on disk too: a stripped release binary is **558 KiB**,
well under the size of `hyprlock` and several times smaller than
`waylock` while shipping more hardening than either. See
[compare.md](compare.md) for the full security and size comparison
against `swaylock`, `waylock`, and `hyprlock`.

Press Alt-B to toggle between a blank screen and the matrix rainfall.

## Why

I was missing waylock on the Niri window manager and decided to write a
new one from scratch &mdash; and because I dig Nim.

## Install build dependencies

`kleis` needs Nim/Nimble, a C toolchain, `pkg-config`, the Nimble package
`nimkdl >= 2.1.0`, and development headers for Wayland, Wayland EGL, EGL,
OpenGL ES 3, xkbcommon, and PAM. The OpenGL ES link dependency is discovered
through the standard `glesv2` pkg-config module, even though the renderer
includes GLES3 headers.

Void Linux:

```sh
sudo xbps-install -Sy nim base-devel pkg-config wayland-devel libglvnd-devel libxkbcommon-devel pam-devel
nimble install -y nimkdl
```

Void, Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu package `nimble` with `nim`.

Arch Linux:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed nim base-devel wayland libglvnd libxkbcommon pam pkgconf
nimble install -y nimkdl
```

Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nim build-essential libwayland-dev libegl-dev libgles-dev libxkbcommon-dev libpam0g-dev pkg-config
nimble install -y nimkdl
```

## Build

Build dependencies:

- Nim `2.2.0` or newer
- Nimble package `nimkdl >= 2.1.0`
- a C compiler
- `pkg-config`
- development packages for `wayland-client`, `xkbcommon`, `pam`, `egl`,
  `glesv2`, and `wayland-egl`
- OpenGL ES 3 headers, normally provided by the same development package
  that provides `glesv2`

Protocol refresh dependency:

- `wayland-scanner`

```sh
nimble build
```

Release builds use checked-in Wayland protocol stubs, so `wayland-scanner`
and `wayland-protocols` are not required unless you are refreshing those
generated files.

## Format

Formatting uses `nph`:

```sh
nimble setupTools
nimble fmt
nimble fmtCheck
```

`nimble setupTools` installs the pinned formatter as a user-level Nimble tool.
`nimble fmt` formats maintained Nim sources. `nimble fmtCheck` is the
non-mutating check form for review or CI. The generated Matrix font source is
left to `nimble regenFont`.

## Deploy

```sh
nimble deploy
```

This builds an optimized release, installs `kleis` to `~/.local/bin/kleis`,
and installs the PAM service file to `/etc/pam.d/kleis`. The binary install
runs as your user; the PAM install uses `sudo` because `/etc/pam.d` is
root-owned.

## Check compositor compatibility

```sh
kleis --check-protocols
```

At runtime, the compositor must advertise:

- `ext_session_lock_manager_v1`
- `wp_viewporter`
- either `wl_shm` or `wp_single_pixel_buffer_manager_v1`

`wl_shm` is used for the default color surfaces when available.
`wp_single_pixel_buffer_manager_v1` is optional and is used for solid-color
buffers when available.

## Wayland protocol sources

`kleis` uses `libwayland-client` directly through a small C shim and
generated protocol stubs. It does not depend on a third-party Wayland wrapper
library; this keeps the C/Nim boundary explicit and leaves protocol handling
on the standard Wayland C stack.

The generated protocol files are checked in under `src/kleis/protocols`.
Their XML sources are vendored in `src/kleis/protocols/xml`:

- `ext-session-lock-v1` from `wayland-protocols/staging`
- `single-pixel-buffer-v1` from `wayland-protocols/staging`
- `viewporter` from `wayland-protocols/stable`
- `xdg-shell` from `wayland-protocols/stable`

To refresh the generated C/header files after updating the XML:

```sh
nimble regenProtocols
```

Refreshing protocols requires `wayland-scanner`. The task regenerates C/H
from the vendored XML only; update the XML from `wayland-protocols` first
when intentionally moving to a newer protocol revision. Commit the XML and
generated C/H changes together. Set `WAYLAND_SCANNER=/path/to/wayland-scanner` to use a non-default scanner.

## Run

```sh
kleis
```

Plain `kleis` shows Matrix rain while idle and ignores the Enter key on an
empty password buffer.

### Battery / power

**If you use a laptop, set `--idle-timeout`.** A continuously rendering GPU
screensaver prevents deep sleep and drains the battery noticeably on an
unattended locked machine. Setting an idle timeout blanks the screen after the
specified number of seconds, letting the system reach low-power states:

```sh
kleis --idle-timeout 60   # blank after 60 s of inactivity
```

The next keypress wakes the screen back to matrix. You can also set this in
`~/.config/kleis/config.kdl` so you never forget it:

```kdl
idle-timeout 60
```

### Other common flags

`--blank` starts on a blank screen instead of matrix rain.
`--allow-empty-password` allows an empty Enter press to reach PAM.
`--no-gpu` forces the CPU renderer and removes EGL from the process (also
useful on systems with unreliable GPU drivers).

For development only, `kleis --dev-mode` makes `Esc` unlock and exit cleanly
without talking to PAM. This is intentionally insecure and should not be used
for a real screen lock, but it provides a compositor-safe escape hatch while
testing kleis itself.

For screenshots while developing the Matrix renderer, use:

```sh
kleis --dev-mode --dev-window
```

This opens the Matrix rain in a normal Wayland window and does not lock the
session or start PAM.

Matrix rain is rendered through a Sokol/EGL/GLES path when available. The glyph
atlas is generated from kleis's built-in high-resolution alpha glyph source,
which is rasterized from the CNTR Koine Greek TrueType font; if GPU setup fails,
kleis warns and falls back to the existing software renderer. The GPU rain
pipeline adapts MIT-licensed shader logic from Rezmason's Matrix rain renderer.
While locked, `Alt-B` toggles between Matrix rain and a blank screen.

Typing rotates the surface through a configurable input palette, and failed
authentication shows a solid failure color. The `--init-color`, `--input-color`
(repeatable), and `--fail-color` flags override the defaults.

### Default palette

| State            | Color       | RGB        |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| At rest (`init`) | Black       | `0x000000` |
| Typing (Father)  | Indigo      | `0x4B0082` |
| Typing (Son)     | Royal Blue  | `0x003366` |
| Typing (Spirit)  | Life Green  | `0x006400` |
| Auth failure     | Crimson     | `0x8B0000` |

Repeating `--input-color` defines a custom palette. The first occurrence
replaces the built-in palette; later occurrences append:

```sh
kleis --input-color 0x111111 --input-color 0x222222 --input-color 0x333333
```

## Configuration

`kleis` reads an optional KDL 2.0 configuration file. The discovery order is:

1. `--config <path>` (must exist if specified),
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kleis/config.kdl` (default `~/.config/kleis/config.kdl`),
3. each `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/kleis/config.kdl` in order (default `/etc/xdg`).

`--no-config` disables the search entirely. CLI flags always win over values
set in the config file. Parse and validation errors abort startup with a
diagnostic on stderr.

A documented template lives at `examples/config.kdl` and is dropped into
`~/.config/kleis/config.kdl` by `nimble installBin`/`nimble deploy` only if
that file does not already exist. Keys absent from the config always take the
built-in default, so an existing config never breaks when new options are
added; diff your file against `examples/config.kdl` after pulling updates to
see what is new. Both `0xRRGGBB` and `#RRGGBB` color forms
are accepted in the config file (the CLI requires the `0x` form).
Legacy Matrix font keys from older templates are accepted as no-ops; Matrix
glyphs now always come from the built-in Koine Greek glyph source.
By default, Matrix glyph size follows the upstream Matrix renderer's 80-column
grid. Set `matrix-cell-scale "auto"` in the config for responsive sizing, or
set it to a number from 1.0 through 8.0 only if you want a fixed glyph scale.

The built-in Matrix glyph alpha data is generated from the vendored CNTR
`KoineGreek.ttf` font in `third_party/cntr-font`, copyright 2012-2023 Alan
Bunning / Center for New Testament Restoration and distributed under CC BY-SA
4.0. Run `nimble regenFont` after changing the vendored font or glyph list; the
generator uses Python with Pillow and fontTools.

## Build size

The release build uses size-oriented flags (`--opt:size --mm:orc
-d:useMalloc -flto -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-s`) so that the KDL parser
and its transitive dependencies (`bigints`, `unicodedb`) do not bloat
the binary. The current stripped output is 558 KiB (570,808 bytes).
Run `nimble sizecheck` to print the size of your build.

## Platform requirements

`kleis` is Linux-only. It relies on the following Linux-specific facilities
to harden the password buffer and the auth child:

- `mlock(2)` and `madvise(MADV_DONTDUMP)` on a page-aligned password buffer,
  preventing it from being paged to swap or included in core dumps.
- Best-effort `mlockall(2)` on the locker process and auth child to keep
  transient password material on the stack and in libc/PAM internals out of
  swap when `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` permits it. Matrix mode and the auth child use
  `MCL_CURRENT`; `--blank` uses `MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE` in the locker
  process.
- `explicit_bzero(3)` (glibc/musl) for password clearing that the compiler
  is not permitted to elide.
- `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)` on both the parent and the auth child to
  block ptrace and `/proc` snooping by other processes of the same UID.
- `prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1)` on the parent after the PAM auth child is
  forked, so future parent-side `execve` cannot gain privileges without
  breaking PAM helpers such as `unix_chkpwd`.
- `setrlimit(RLIMIT_CORE, 0)` to suppress core dumps for the locker.
- `close_range(2)` (kernel 5.9+) in the auth child to drop inherited file
  descriptors before invoking PAM; falls back to a manual loop on older
  kernels.

## Security

`kleis` mirrors waylock's privilege-separation model: the parent process
holds the Wayland connection and renders the lock surface, while a forked
child performs PAM authentication over a length-prefixed pipe. The
password buffer:

- has a fixed `1024`-byte capacity rounded up to a page,
- is allocated via `posix_memalign` and `mlock`'d for its lifetime,
- is excluded from core dumps via `madvise(MADV_DONTDUMP)`,
- is zeroed via `explicit_bzero` on every clear (including after each
  failed authentication and after each `Backspace`),
- has its protections re-applied after `--fork-on-lock`.

The auth child also re-applies best-effort `mlockall(MCL_CURRENT)` before
initializing PAM, because memory locks are not inherited across `fork(2)`.

With `--fork-on-lock`, the background process additionally redirects
`stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` to `/dev/null` to avoid `SIGPIPE` if the parent
shell is closed.

`RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` must be at least the password buffer size (one page).
Process-wide `mlockall` needs more headroom and can fail under normal
desktop mappings or restrictive limits. That best-effort failure is reported
only at `--log-level debug`; the locker continues with the password buffer's
own mandatory `mlock` still active.

See [audit.md](audit.md) for the running security and performance review log,
including the recent PAM, Matrix renderer, signal handling, and SHM sizing
checks.

## PAM stack

`kleis` performs authentication through PAM. The shipped default
`pam.d/kleis` is a minimal, auditable, distribution-independent chain:

```
auth        optional      pam_faildelay.so delay=2000000
auth        required      pam_unix.so     nullok
account     required      pam_unix.so
```

This verifies a plain Unix password and applies a two-second failure delay
without recording faillock tallies or locking the user out after mistyped
passwords. That avoids the bad screen-locker failure mode where three
incorrect attempts can block a later correct password for several minutes.
Most Linux users authenticate this way and gain nothing from a larger PAM
stack on their screen locker, so this is the default.

The default does NOT enable `pam_systemd_home`, GNOME Keyring or
KWallet auto-unlock, fingerprint readers, smartcards, or any other
auxiliary auth method. If you need any of those, install the full PAM
file instead:

```sh
nimble installPamFull
# or, without nimble:
sudo install -m 0644 pam.d/kleis.full /etc/pam.d/kleis
```

The full file contains a single line, `auth include system-auth`, which
delegates authentication to the distribution's `system-auth` chain.
This is the same approach `waylock` and most other screen lockers ship
with. The trade-off is that `kleis`'s effective auth surface becomes
whatever `system-auth` says it is. To audit it, read
`/etc/pam.d/system-auth`; edits there (for example a debugging
`auth sufficient pam_permit.so` line, or a `pam_succeed_if` clause that
bypasses checks for a group) silently affect `kleis` as well, and
`kleis` cannot defend against this.

For PAM debugging, run `./kleis --log-level debug --blank --dev-mode` from
a terminal. Debug logging records PAM status codes and messages only; it
does not log password contents, password length, or prompts. In `--dev-mode`,
`Esc` exits without asking PAM, which keeps manual auth tests recoverable.

To revert to the default minimal chain at any time:

```sh
nimble installPam
```
